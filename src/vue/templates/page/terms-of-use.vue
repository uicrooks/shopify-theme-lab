            12. SMS/MMS Mobile Messaging Marketing Program
          </h3>
          <p class="terms-description">
            Dr. Squatch offers a mobile messaging program (the “Program”), where, if you opt-in to the Program, you agree to these Terms and to receive marketing text messages from us. The Program is optional and not a condition of purchase. The Program allows Users to receive SMS/MMS mobile messages by voluntarily and affirmatively opting into the Program, such as through online or application-based enrollment forms. The messages we send to you include marketing messages, and may also include cart abandon messages, as well as messages allowing you to make purchases using previously-saved account information or account information that you provide, and messaging frequency may vary. You must have a wireless device of your own, capable of two-way messaging, be using a participating wireless carrier, and be a wireless service subscriber with text messaging service. Not all cellular phone providers carry the necessary service to participate. Check your phone capabilities for specific text messaging instructions.
            <br>
            <br>
            Regardless of the opt-in method you utilized to join the Program, you agree that these Terms apply to your participation in the Program. By participating in the Program, you agree to receive autodialed or prerecorded marketing mobile messages at the phone number associated with your opt-in, and you understand that consent is not required to make any purchase from Dr. Squatch. While you consent to receive messages sent using an autodialer, the foregoing shall not be interpreted to suggest or imply that any or all of Dr. Squatch’s mobile messages are sent using an automatic telephone dialing system (“ATDS” or “autodialer”). Message and data rates may apply. Please consult your mobile service carrier’s pricing plan to determine the charges for browsing data and sending and receiving mobile messages. Under no circumstances will we be responsible for any messaging or wireless charges incurred by you or by a person that has access to your wireless device or telephone number.
            <br>
            <br>
            SMS/MMS MOBILE MESSAGING OPT-OUT: If you do not wish to continue participating in the Program, you agree to reply STOP, END, CANCEL, UNSUBSCRIBE, or QUIT to any mobile message from Dr. Squatch in order to opt out of the Program. You may receive an additional mobile message confirming your decision to opt out. You understand and agree that the foregoing options are the only reasonable methods of opting out. You also understand and agree that any other method of opting out, including, but not limited to, texting words other than those set forth above or verbally requesting one of our employees to remove you from our list, is not a reasonable means of opting out.
            <br>
            <br>
            DUTY TO NOTIFY AND INDEMNIFY REGARDING SMS/MMS MOBILE MESSAGING: If at any time you intend to stop using the mobile telephone number that has been used to subscribe to the Program, including canceling your service plan or selling or transferring the phone number to another party, you agree that you will complete the opt-out process set forth above prior to ending your use of the mobile telephone number. You understand and agree that your agreement to do so is a material part of these terms and conditions. You further agree that, if you discontinue the use of your mobile telephone number without notifying us of such change, you agree that you will be responsible for all costs (including attorneys’ fees) and liabilities incurred by us, or any party that assists in the delivery of the mobile messages, as a result of claims brought by individual(s) who are later assigned that mobile telephone number. This duty and agreement shall survive any cancellation or termination of your agreement to participate in any of our Programs.
            <br>
            <br>
            YOU AGREE THAT YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, AND HOLD US HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIM OR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM YOUR FAILURE TO NOTIFY US OF A CHANGE IN THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE PROVIDED, INCLUDING ANY CLAIM OR LIABILITY UNDER THE TELEPHONE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 47 U.S.C. § 227, et seq., OR SIMILAR STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS, AND ANY REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER RESULTING FROM US ATTEMPTING TO CONTACT YOU AT THE MOBILE TELEPHONE NUMBER YOU PROVIDED.
            <br>
            <br>
            Without limiting the scope of the Program, users that opt into the Program can expect to receive messages concerning the marketing and sale of digital and physical products, services, and events. Message and data rates may apply. The Program involves recurring mobile messages, and additional mobile messages may be sent periodically based on your interaction with us. For support regarding the Program, text “HELP” to the number you received messages from or email us at <a href="mailto:support@drsquatch.com">support@drsquatch.com</a>. Opt outs should be submitted in accordance with the procedures set forth above. The Program is offered on an "as-is" basis and may not be available in all areas at all times and may not continue to work in the event of product, software, coverage or other changes made by your wireless carrier. We will not be liable for any delays or failures in the receipt of any mobile messages connected with this Program. Delivery of mobile messages is subject to effective transmission from your wireless service provider/network operator and is outside of our control; Dr. Squatch is not liable for delayed or undelivered mobile messages.
            <br>
            <br>
            MMS DISCLOSURE: The Program will send SMS TMs (terminating messages) if your mobile device does not support MMS messaging.
